# coding-quiz



## Description
 
 To create a a short quiz using javascript with a leaderboard of highscores that pulls from local store, a timer that counts down as you start the game and a score at the end! during this homework i learned so much and furthered my knowledge on JS with help of my tutor, by using functions for loops and addevent listeners i was able to creat my mini coding quiz! 



## Usage

the user will be able to log and save their daily tasks! The calender will match up to the time of the day and display it at the top. if is it the present hour the section will be red, if the past it will be gray and if its coming up in the future it will be green! i learned in this homework how to grab the time from dayjs and have it equal the id of the hour instead of creating a function for each hour of the day
